# Pawn Stars Website

This is a simple one-page website for Pawn Stars, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## To Deploy on GitHub Pages:

1.  Ensure this `WebsiteDesign` folder (or its contents) is the root of your GitHub Pages site, or that GitHub Pages is configured to serve from this folder.
2.  The main page is `index.html`.
3.  All assets (images, CSS, JS) are linked relatively and should be in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Structure:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: Contains all the styles for the website.
*   `script.js`: For any future JavaScript interactivity.
*   Images (e.g., `LogoDesign.png`, `pawnstarsbanner.jpg`, etc.) are stored in this directory.
